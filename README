MAXIMUM CENTRE-DISJOINT MERGEABLE DISKS
=======================================

This program finds solutions to instances of the problem introduced in
the paper titled "Maximum Centre-disjoint Mergeable Disks" using an
integer program.  The program uses Python's PuLP library, which can
execute a number of different external tools for solving linear
programs.

To use the program, first install PuLP if it is not already installed:

  $ pip install pulp

Then, invoke the program as follows:

  $ python mcmd.py <1.txt

The program reads the set of input disks from the standard input.
Each line of the input describes a disk as three values: the
x-coordinate, the y-coordinate, and the radius of the disk.  By
default, Euclidean distance is used.  If the coordinates use latitude
and longitude, the -v option can be provided; the radius is assumed to
be in meters with this option.

A few examples are included in this package as .txt files.  For
schools in Munich (figure 2 of the paper):

  $ python mcmd.py -v <2.txt
